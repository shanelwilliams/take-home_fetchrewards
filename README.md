# take-home_fetchrewards

-Created a form that requested info from a user to submit to the client. 
-Preformed the basics of the form in the HTML file. Used fetch to request the data from the API. Created an option to send the data from API into a dropdown menu for occupations and states using a forEach method.
-With the info entered on the form and a submit button. Created an addEventListener for the submit in order to take the newForm data and Post that info back into the API.
This project allowed me to expand my knowlegde on how to use a Post and also I had never done a drop down before. It turned into a great exercise after getting through the errors.
